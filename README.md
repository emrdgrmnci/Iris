# Iris.app

Iris is a macOS application that displays your webcam feed in a circular, always-on-top window.

## Features

* **Menu Bar Only** - Lives in the menu bar, doesn't occupy the Dock
* **Always On Top** - Window stays above other applications
* **Circular Window** - Perfectly circular shape with smooth edges
* **Resizable** - Drag from the edges of the circle to resize
* **Toggle Visibility** - Click menu bar icon to show/hide window
* **Camera Selection** - Choose from multiple camera sources
* **Launch at Login** - Optionally start on system login
* **Persistent State** - Remembers size, position, and camera selection

## Requirements

* macOS 13.0 or later
* **Full Xcode installation** (not just Command Line Tools)
  - Download from the [Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/xcode/id497799835)
  - Command Line Tools alone are not sufficient for building macOS apps

## Building

### First Time Setup

1. Install Xcode from the Mac App Store
2. Open Xcode and agree to the license agreement
3. Set the command line tools path:
   ```bash
   sudo xcode-select --switch /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer
   ```

### Build Commands

```bash
# Build the app
./build.sh

# Build and run
./run.sh

# Clean build artifacts
./clean.sh
```

The built application will be located at `Iris/build/Release/Iris.app`.

## Usage

1. Launch the app using `./run.sh` or by opening `Iris.app`
2. Grant camera permissions when prompted
3. The app icon will appear in your menu bar (top right)
4. Click the icon to toggle the window visibility
5. Right-click the icon (or click and hold) to access:
   - Camera selection
   - Launch at login setting
   - Quit option

### Interacting with the Window

* **Move**: Click and drag anywhere inside the circle
* **Resize**: Click and drag from the edge of the circle
* **Hide**: Click the menu bar icon

## Camera Permissions

On first launch, macOS will prompt you to grant camera access. If you deny permission:
1. Open System Settings
2. Go to Privacy & Security > Camera
3. Enable camera access for Iris

## Development

This is an LLM-agent-coded project. See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for development principles and [design/](design/) for feature specifications.

```

## Troubleshooting

### "xcodebuild requires Xcode" error
Install full Xcode from the App Store, not just Command Line Tools.

### App doesn't appear in menu bar
The app is menu-bar-only (no Dock icon). Look for the eye icon (👁) in the top-right menu bar.

### Camera not working
Check System Settings > Privacy & Security > Camera and ensure Iris has permission.

### Window disappeared
Click the menu bar icon to show it again. The app remembers window position between launches.
